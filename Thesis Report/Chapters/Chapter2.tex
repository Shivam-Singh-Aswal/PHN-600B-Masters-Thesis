\section{$1+1D$ gravity coupled to constant EM field strength}
\label{castro-paper}

In a paper authored by \textit{Castro et al.} \cite{castro2019}, the authors explore the dynamics of a $1+1D$ gravity theory coupled to a constant electromagnetic field strength. The paper delves into the implications of this coupling on the gravitational dynamics and the resulting spacetime structure.
