This thesis investigates lower-dimensional theories of gravity and their dual conformal field theories within the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence and the Holographic Principle. Emphasis is placed on two- and three-dimensional models where gravity is coupled to ModMax electrodynamics --- a non-linear generalization of Maxwell theory that retains conformal symmetry and the SO(2) electric-magnetic duality. The central theme of the thesis, particularly in Chapter 3, is the attempt to calculation and comparison of central charges in these lower-dimensional theories, which play a crucial role in characterizing the dual boundary CFTs.

We begin with a four-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert action coupled to the ModMax Lagrangian. The theory is then dimensionally reduced to obtain effective three-dimensional and two-dimensional gravitational actions. This reduction is carried out using consistent metric ansatz, which preserve the conformal structure and allow us to derive equations of motion, stress-energy tensors, and gauge field dynamics in the lower-dimensional frameworks.

In the three-dimensional case, the central charge is computed by analyzing the transformation of the boundary stress-energy tensor under diffeomorphisms and accompanying gauge transformations that preserve the boundary conditions. 

%The coefficient of the anomalous term in the stress tensor transformation gives the central charge:
\[
%c_{3D} = \frac{1}{144\sqrt{3}\pi G_2}(\alpha - 12\beta\alpha + 2\alpha^2),
\]
%where $\alpha$ is a coupling constant and $\beta$ is the ModMax non-linearity parameter. This expression generalizes the result for the Maxwell case, which is recovered in the $\beta \to 0$ limit.

Subsequently, a further reduction from three to two dimensions is to be performed to derive the 2D effective action. This process also involves an appropriate choice of boundary conditions and the use of the Fefferman-Graham gauge to facilitate asymptotic analysis. The 2D central charge is then extracted using a similar method, analyzing the transformation of the boundary stress-energy tensor under combined conformal and gauge symmetries.

In conclusion, in this work we set out to demonstrate that central charge calculations in ModMax-coupled gravity are tractable in both 2D and 3D settings. However the equations of motions were too complex to be solved in the limiited time we had. Thus it will be taken as a future endeavour to carry out the calculation with the choices of metric made. }

I am deeply grateful to my parents for their unconditional love, patience, and encouragement throughout my academic journey. Their belief in me has been a constant source of strength and motivation, especially during challenging times. Without their support, this thesis and the completion of my degree would not have been possible.

Finally, I would like to thank everyone who, in one way or another, contributed to my personal and academic growth over the past few years. Each interaction, challenge, and success has helped shape who I am today, and for that, I am truly thankful.
